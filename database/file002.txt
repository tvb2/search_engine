novosiltsevs dispatch you know everything what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone as she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i dont speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children
